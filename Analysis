The county needs to focus on promoting Charter Schools and making schools smaller in order to promote higher grades. A higher Teacher to Student Ratio must happen in order to improve grades in low performing schools.

Charter schools tend to perform better in all aspects than district schools.

Schools with fewer students perform better in terms of overall passing %.

The higher the funding the lower the overall passing. Due to the fact that highly funded schools tend to have more students.
